## What is Morse Code?

Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as sequences of dots (.) and dashes (-). It was widely used before digital communication became standard and is still recognized for its simplicity and reliability in emergency communication.

## Historical Context

Morse code was developed in the early 1830s and 1840s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail. It was originally designed for use with the electric telegraph and played a critical role in early long-distance communication. Morse code enabled quick transmission of textual information using standardized signals.

## How Morse Code Works

Morse code represents each character (letters, numbers, and punctuation) with a unique sequence of **dots (.)** and **dashes (-)**.

- A **dot** represents a short signal.
- A **dash** represents a longer signal.

For example:
- A = `. -`
- B = `- . . .`
- C = `- . - .`
- SOS = `... --- ...`

Spaces are used to separate individual letters and words:
- One space ( ) = Letter separator
- Three spaces (   ) = Word separator

## Example Translations

Here are a few words translated into Morse code:

| Word   | Morse Code              |
|--------|--------------------------|
| HELLO  | `.... . .-.. .-.. ---`   |
| WORLD  | `.-- --- .-. .-.. -..`   |
| CODE   | `-.-. --- -.. .`         |
